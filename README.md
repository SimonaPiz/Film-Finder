## About this project

In this project, I use my knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. You’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.

> Use this database for data [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)

## Objective

### Main Tasks

- Populate Drop-down Menu with Genres
- Get a Random Movie
- Get Movie Info
- Display Movie

### Extra challanges

- Displaying different types of information like cast, or release date.
- Create a way to store a user’s liked and disliked movies and display this list on the page.
- randomize our results so that `movies` contains results from a random page instead of the first page.

## Technologies
- Html
- Css
- JavaScript
- use API [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)
